# A simple personal page
This is the repo of my previous webpage

# How to use it?
### First of all, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saul-BT/saul-bt.github.io.git
```
Nice, now you can manipulate and use it.

### Getting started
You can edit the `html` file easily by reading the comments and _TODO's_.

List of elements you can edit:
- Title
- Meta tags
- The Whoami paragraph
- The Knowledge paragraphs and lists
- The purposes list
- The projects anchors

### Finally set it as your personal webpage
- Upload the files on GitHub.
- Change the name of repo to `your_alias.github.io`.
- In settings of repo set `GitHub Pages > Source` to `master branch` and save.
